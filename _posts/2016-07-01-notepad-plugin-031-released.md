Today we released version 0.3.1 of the [Notepad++ plug-in](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-notepad-plus-plus).

The plug-in now adds an AboutBox to show version information and a clickable link to the homepage.

Starting from this version we no longer support the ANSI version of Notepad++, whose support has
been dropped since March 2012.

You can download it from the
[SourceForge downloads page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/editorconfig/files/EditorConfig-Notepad%2B%2B-Plugin/),
or use the Notepad++ plug-in manager to get the update.
