Today we released version 0.3.1 of the [Notepad++ plug-in](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-notepad-plus-plus).

The plug-in adds an AboutBox to show version information and a clickable link to the home page.

Since this release we no longer supply an ANSI plug-in. Notepad++ dropped the support for the ANSI-version in March 2012.

You can download it from the [SourceForge downloads page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/editorconfig/files/EditorConfig-Notepad%2B%2B-Plugin/), or wait for the Notepad++ plug-in manager to get the update.
