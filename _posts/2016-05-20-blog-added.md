We added a simple blog to the website. We will use this blog mainly for
announcements like updates to the core libraries or to plug-ins.

We are using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to create our website and blog.
To add your own posts to the blog, add a page in the `_posts` subdir as described in
[Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/). Create a [pull request](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig.github.com/pulls)
to get your post included on the website.
